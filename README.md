# C-HashMap
A simple hashmap for the C language.
## How to use.
The hashmap is pretty simple, you need to Call ```createMap```, and supply functions for hashing, comparison and freeing your data structure memory.\
The built-in functions will handle the freeing, growing, rehashing by using your function. \
It also comes with some built-in functions for string hashing, and freeing heap memory.
### function documentation

### hashMap.c

#### ```createMap(int length, unsigned int (*hash)(void*), int(*compare)(void*,void*), void (*free)(Entry))```
returns a HashMap* equipped with the specified capacity and functions.

#### ```rehash(HashMap* map)```
this function is used to redo the hashes on a map, it is not called automatically.

#### ```growMap(HashMap* map, unsigned int inc)```
this function grows the given map by the increment.

#### ```int addPair(HashMap* map, void* key, void* val)```
this function adds a pair to a map, taking a key, and a value, returning 1 if the key was already in the map, returning 0 otherwise.

#### ```int removeKey(HashMap* map, void* key)```
removes the specified key, freeing the memory using the void(*free)(Entry) function and flagging the key pointer of it's entry as NULL, permitting reassigning to the slot.\
returns 0 if key was deleted, and returns 1 if an equal key was not found using int(compare)(void*,void*).
#### ```void* getValue(HashMap* map, void* key)```
returns the value associated with the key (as a void*).\
if an equal key was not found with int(compare)(void*,void*), returns (void*) NULL, and sets mapErr to MAP_NOSUCH.
#### ```void clearMap(HashMap* map)```
frees all the entries of a HashMap, but keeps the map allocated.

#### ```discardMap(HashMap* map)```
frees all memory in the map, including all assigned key value pairs.frees all memory in the map, including all assigned key value pairs.

#### int mapErr
global variable to handle map errors.

#### ```unsigned int defHash(void* key)```
very shitty default hash function that should return on anything.

#### ```unsigned int strHash(void* key)```
function to hash null terminated strings.

#### ```void defaultFree(Entry* entry)```
default free implementation
